# Road2Employment (R2E)

*A personal momentum tracker that grew from one person's need to a community of goal-crushers*

## The Story

I built this app because I was burning out. As someone grinding through job applications, coding projects, gym sessions, and learning new skills, I needed a way to track my weekly progress without losing sight of what I was actually accomplishing.

The problem wasn't lack of motivation, it was lack of visibility. I'd work hard all week, then feel like I hadn't done anything meaningful. Sound familiar?

So I created this momentum tracker for myself. A simple way to:
- Log every meaningful task I completed
- See my weekly progress in real-time  
- Prevent burnout by celebrating small wins
- Stay accountable to my goals

It worked so well that my friends and peers started asking to use it. Now it's helping a growing community of job seekers, developers, and ambitious people stay on track with their goals.
