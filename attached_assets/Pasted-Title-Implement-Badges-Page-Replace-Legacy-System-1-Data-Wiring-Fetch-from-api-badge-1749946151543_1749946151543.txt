Title: Implement Badges Page & Replace Legacy System

## 1. Data Wiring
- **Fetch** from `/api/badges` (or equivalent) on mount:
  - `allBadges: Badge[]` — includes `{ id, title, description, iconName, rarity, xp, criteria, unlockedDate? }`
- **Remove** any legacy badge code—use only the new API shape.

## 2. Page Layout (`/badges`)
1. **Stats Row** (cards):
   - **Total Badges**: count of `allBadges`
   - **Total XP**: sum of `xp` for unlocked badges
   - **Legendary**: count where `rarity === 'legendary'` and `unlockedDate` present
   - **Recent Badges**: show the 3 most recently `unlockedDate` badges

2. **Empty State** (when no unlocked badges):
   - Centered trophy icon + “No Badges Yet”
   - Subtitle: “Start completing tasks to unlock your first achievements!”
   - Mini-list of example badge types:
     • Consistency streaks  
     • Task completion milestones  
     • Weekly goal achievements  
     • Special activity patterns  

3. **Badge Gallery** (grid):
   - 3–4 columns on desktop, 1–2 on mobile.
   - **Card** for each badge:
     - **Icon**: SVG (use `lucide-react` or supplied `iconName`)
     - **Title** (bold)
     - **Rarity Tag**: pill (Common / Uncommon / Rare / Legendary) with distinct tailwind colors:
       - `gray` / `green` / `blue` / `orange`
     - **Description** (smaller text)
     - **Locked Overlay**: if `!unlockedDate`, render a semi-opaque cover with a lock icon and “Locked” label.
     - **Unlocked Date**: if `unlockedDate`, show e.g. “Unlocked Jun 12, 2025”

4. **Rarity Legend** (footer):
   - Recreate the “Badge Rarity System” bar:
     - `Common – Basic achievements`
     - `Uncommon – Regular milestones`
     - `Rare – Significant progress`
     - `Legendary – Exceptional feats`
   - Use matching pill colors.

## 3. Interactivity & Performance
- **Lazy-load** badge icons and grid (e.g. React’s `Suspense`/`lazy`).
- **Filter Bar** (optional): top-right dropdown to filter by rarity or show only unlocked/locked.
- **Responsive**: ensure grid reflows and stats row stacks on narrow screens.
- **Loading State**: skeleton cards while fetching.

## Outcome
A complete Badges page that:
- Reuses your existing rarity legend and example copy.
- Fully displays unlocked vs locked badges in an attractive grid.
- Surfaces key stats at the top.
- Replaces any old badge wiring with a single source of truth from `/api/badges`.
