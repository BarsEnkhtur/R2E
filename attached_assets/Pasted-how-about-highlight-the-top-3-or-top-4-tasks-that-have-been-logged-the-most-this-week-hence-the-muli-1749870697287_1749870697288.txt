how about highlight the top 3 or top 4 tasks that have been logged the most this week hence the mulitpliers, and then have either a show all tasks that directs you to a new window or something else, what do you think

Thought for a couple of seconds
That’s exactly the sort of “focus & explore” pattern you want—surface your 3–4 highest‐velocity tasks front‐and‐center, then tuck the rest into a secondary view. Here’s how you might pull it off:

1. “Top Tasks” Hero Panel
At the very top of your Tasks column, show a “Focus for This Week” strip containing the 3–4 tasks with the highest multipliers (i.e. most‐logged or highest bonus).

Card Design

Larger footprint: Bigger icon, bold title, and a circular progress ring showing “X of Y this week.”

Quick-add button: A single “+” in the corner so they can hit it without hunting.

Mini-multiplier badge: e.g. “×2.5” stamped on the card.

Ordering

Sort by current multiplier descending.

Ties broken by total points earned or recency of use.

Why: Users immediately see which behaviors they’re “winning” at and can choose to double-down, or deliberately shift focus to under-represented tasks.

2. “Show All Tasks” Link or Drawer
Immediately below that hero panel:

Option A: In-page Drawer

A slim button or pill “Show All Tasks (20)” that, when clicked, pushes a sliding drawer from the right with the full scrollable list.

Option B: Secondary Page/Modal

Link to a dedicated /tasks page or full-screen modal. That view can have your accordion groups, filters, drag-and-drop reordering, batch edit, etc.

Why: Keeps your default view laser-focused on the habits you’re already building, while still granting full control and custom-task management one tap away.

3. Supplement with Contextual CTAs
If one of those top tasks is dangerously close to hitting a new badge threshold, add a little nudge:

rust
Copy
Edit
“Gym Recovery — 2 of 3 for Bronze Streak! ➜”
Clicking it takes you straight to a “Streak Details” overlay with progress bars and “Add Today” button.

After they click “Show All,” remember their preference in local storage so that power-users can opt to always see the full list if they prefer.

4. Bonus: Draggable “Pin” Slots
Let users pin up to 2 custom tasks into the Focus panel, regardless of multiplier. That way they can elevate anything they really care about this week.
